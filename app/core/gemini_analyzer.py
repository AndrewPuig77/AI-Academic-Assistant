        💡 HYPOTHESIS BUILDER:

        **1. Extension Hypotheses**
        • Hypotheses that extend current findings to new contexts
        • Predictions about scaling or generalizing results
        • Hypotheses about boundary conditions

        **2. Mechanism Hypotheses**
        • Hypotheses about underlying mechanisms not fully explored
        • Causal pathway hypotheses
        • Process improvement hypotheses

        **3. Comparative Hypotheses**
        • Hypotheses comparing different approaches or conditions
        • Hypotheses about relative effectiveness
        • Hypotheses about optimal parameters

        **4. Interaction Hypotheses**
        • Hypotheses about variable interactions not tested
        • Hypotheses about contextual moderators
        • Hypotheses about synergistic effects

        **5. Novel Application Hypotheses**
        • Hypotheses about applying findings to new domains
        • Hypotheses about cross-disciplinary applications
        • Hypotheses about practical implementations

        **6. Contradiction/Alternative Hypotheses**
        • Alternative explanations for observed phenomena
        • Hypotheses that challenge current assumptions
        • Hypotheses about conflicting findings

        Format each hypothesis as: "H: [Testable statement]" followed by brief justification and suggested testing approach.
